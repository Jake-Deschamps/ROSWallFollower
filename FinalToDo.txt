-Make sure PI control is actually needed
-Track which files are actually being used. Perhaps retitle them or recomment them
-Check comments for additional todos and add them here:
-Obtain the following graphics:
    -Use one of the debug programs to show the diagram of nodes and topics
    -Use Visio to make the control loop
-Test the slightly tweaked nav_routine7


Plan:
-Send email to construct to ask how this works:
    -What date/time for availability
    -What program I'll use to share my screen/call in
    -Can I stream a ppt?
    -What tone?
-Make a first draft of the presentation to get the ball rolling!
